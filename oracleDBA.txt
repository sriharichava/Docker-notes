Database Buffer Cache
The Database Buffer Cache is a fairly large memory object that stores the actual data blocks that are retrieved from datafiles by system
queries and other data manipulation language commands..

There are three buffer states:
·        Unused - a buffer is available for use - it has never been used or is currently unused.
·        Clean - a buffer that was used earlier - the data has been written to disk.
·        Dirty - a buffer that has modified data that has not been written to disk.


Each buffer has one of two access modes:
·        Pinned - a buffer is pinned so it does not age out of memory.
·        Free (unpinned).

 
KEEP Buffer Pool:
This pool retains blocks in memory (data from tables) that are likely to be reused throughout daily processing.  
An example might be a table containing user names and passwords or a validation table of some type.
The DB_KEEP_CACHE_SIZE parameter sizes the KEEP Buffer Pool.

RECYCLE Buffer Pool

This pool is used to store table data that is unlikely to be reused throughout daily processing – 
thus the data blocks are quickly removed from memory when not needed.

The DB_RECYCLE_CACHE_SIZE parameter sizes the Recycle Buffer Pool.
